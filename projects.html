    <h2>Projects and its Description</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fake News Detector</strong> – Developed a machine learning model capable of identifying and classifying news articles as fake or genuine. The model was trained on a large, diverse dataset of news content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier. This project focuses on improving content credibility detection, enabling users to combat misinformation in real time.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>To-Do List Webpage</strong> – Designed and implemented a user-friendly task management tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as set reminders for upcoming deadlines. The interface was built to be responsive, ensuring accessibility across devices, and includes local storage integration so tasks remain saved even after the browser is closed.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Portfolio Website</strong> – Created a personal portfolio website to showcase my education, skills, and projects. Built using HTML and CSS, the website features a clean, modern, and fully responsive design. It includes smooth navigation, structured content sections, and optimized styling for both desktop and mobile viewing, allowing visitors to quickly learn about my background and expertise.</li>
